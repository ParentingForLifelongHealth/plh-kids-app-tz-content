“Come, Jabulani,” Ma says.
“Why aren’t you ready?
You’ll be late for school.”
“I can’t find my shoe,”
says Jabulani.

“Did you look in the wardrobe?” Ma asks.
“Yes, it’s not in the wardrobe.”

“Did you look under your bed?” says Ma.
“It’s not under my bed,” Jabulani says.

“I know where your
shoe is,” giggles
Jabulani’s sister Lungi.
“Where?” Jabulani asks.

“I’m not telling you!”
says Lungi

“Somebody’s taken it,” Jabulani says.

“Why would someone take one shoe
when they’ve got two feet?” says Lungi.

“I don’t know. Maybe
they’ve hidden it to
make me cross.”

“Did you take my shoe?”
he asks Lungi.

“No,” says Lungi,
“your shoes are
too big for me.”

“Did you take my shoe?”
Jabulani asks Fruit Juice
the Dog.

She smiles her big dog
smile at him and wags
her tail.

“Maybe a bird picked it up
and flew away with your
shoe,” laughs Lungi.

“Maybe a monkey took it and left
it up in a tree,” says Jabulani.

“Don’t worry, we’ll find your shoe,” says Ma.
“Everyone look for Jabulani’s shoe.”
But the shoe is nowhere to be found.

“It’s all right,” says Ma.
“You can wear your takkies to school today.”

Lungi comes rushing into the kitchen with a
big smile on her face.
“I know where your shoe is,” she shouts.
“Come and see.”
