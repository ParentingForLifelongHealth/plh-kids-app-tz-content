I did not want to spoil my child so that he thinks we have to do everything together. \n\nBut after thinking about how good I feel when someone makes an effort to spend time with me and to listen to me, I thought that this might be really good for my child as well. So I decided to try it. \n\nI sat down next to my child and suggested that we draw a picture together. I asked her what she would like to draw. She suggested we draw our house and garden. I asked her what she would like me to draw, and she said I can draw the tree outside our house, while she draws the house. It was actually really relaxing to sit and do something together. We had a nice discussion about some of our favourite things about our home and what we enjoy doing together as a family."
